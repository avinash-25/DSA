## Reading Comprehension

### Passage 1: Labour Theory of Value

**Passage:**

According to philosopher John Locke, labour provides the only justifiable claim to the market value of the goods produced. He categorically states that the total value of any applicable product can be attributed solely to labour contributions. This theory popularly came to be known as Locke's theory of labour value, which recognises and celebrates the contributions of labour to the value of the worldly things that we commonly enjoy.

The advocates of this theory, apart from exalting labour efforts, go further into trivialising any contribution from the employer. Their numerous statements about the market forces that determine the price of goods overlook the importance of the wage-payer and highlight only the hours devoted by the workforce. Furthermore, they usually assume that employees will almost always get the worst part of any deal made by the employers, resulting in the exploitation of the workforce and the appropriation of the product's value by the employer. In simpler terms, any part of the product's value taken in as profit by the employer is 'theft.'

Admittedly, many economists will identify labour as a contributor to the value of commodities, but the notion that human work is solely responsible for this value is highly absurd. Human effort is a valuable component of producing goods, but so are capital goods such as land, capital, machines, etc.

In the current market scenario, these capital goods account for nearly 33 per cent of the total output of consumer goods. The remaining share is distributed equally as wages for labour and compensation to owners. Additionally, as do shareholders or pensioners, labour consumes a part of the output. The labour theory of value conveniently disregards the contribution of capital goods and perpetuates a misleading scenario, a shortcoming for which Locke must be partly blamed.

**Question 17: Which of the given arguments would an advocate of the labour theory of value be most likely to use in response to its criticism?**

Options:

- The author's example of shareholders is flawed because only a small percentage of the workforce owns shares
- The productive contributions of capital goods should be valued no less than the contributions of the labour force
- The productive contributions of capital goods should be disregarded, given the time required to maintain these goods
- **The productive contribution of capital goods must be attributed to labour alone, as capital goods are the result of labour itself** ✓

**Answer: The productive contribution of capital goods must be attributed to labour alone, as capital goods are the result of labour itself**

_Explanation: This argument is consistent with the labour theory of value, which attributes all value to labour, including the value created by capital goods (which were themselves created by labour)_

### Passage 2: Ultramarine Blue in Art History

**Passage:**

In 17th century Europe, when popular painters painted their famous masterworks, an ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn't until the industrial revolution in the 19th century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and the true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.

Across the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by Spanish artists were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that archaeologists discovered that the Maya civilisation had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.

The ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.

**Question 18: What inference can be made about the impact of the industrial revolution on the art world, based on the passage?**

Options:

- The industrial revolution led to a decline in the quality of pigments used by artists
- **The availability of synthetic ultramarine allowed artists to experiment with new techniques and subjects** ✓
- Artists began to reject synthetic pigments in favour of traditional materials like lapis lazuli
- The industrial revolution had no significant effect on the use of colour in art

**Answer: The availability of synthetic ultramarine allowed artists to experiment with new techniques and subjects**

_Explanation: The passage states that synthetic ultramarine "finally became widely available" after the industrial revolution, implying broader artistic access and possibilities_

### Passage 3: Service Investment and Competitive Advantage

**Passage:**

The competition in the current market economy is not just intense, it is a complex web of factors becoming more intense and fiercer each day. Adding fuel to the fire is the globalisation of competition and increased deregulation, which are revolutionising markets at unprecedented rates. With many companies aggressively seeking positional and strategic advantages, analysts have strongly emphasised service improvement to attain a competitive advantage and improve performance. But to regard superior service as a magical solution would be grossly misleading.

Investments in service, like those in logistics, must be carefully balanced against other types of investments, such as branding, marketing, etc., based on the direct, tangible benefits to the company, such as increased profitability. It has been observed that investments in service by companies already providing service at par with their competitors would only offer little to no competitive advantage. If the company maintains an acceptable level of service and prevents its customers from leaving at an alarming rate, any investment in service would result in wasteful expenditure.

This truth was not evident to the managers of one supermarket chain, which failed to enhance its competitive position despite its investment in new computing systems that minimised billing errors and reduced waiting times and complaints. The consequences were severe. Firstly, the managers failed to comprehend that customers usually do not prefer switching from their preferred supermarket chains for various reasons such as distance, convenience, etc. Secondly, they underestimated the importance of establishing strong personal ties with the customer and misbelieved that efficient computation would attract newer market segments. Finally, they failed to execute the strategy discreetly, making it easier for competitors to replicate the advantage.

The only visible advantage of this strategy was experienced by the accounting departments, which could manage audits efficiently because of the minimal billing errors.

**Question 19: Which of the given statements about the service provided by the supermarket chain before its unsuccessful investment in service can be inferred from the passage?**

Options:

- **It was sufficient to retain the customers at an acceptable rate** ✓
- It was bringing the reputation of the chain to an alarmingly low level
- It needed improvement to match the service provided by the chain's competitors
- It was slightly better than the service provided by the chain's competitors

**Answer: It was sufficient to retain the customers at an acceptable rate**

_Explanation: The passage mentions that "If the company maintains an acceptable level of service and prevents its customers from leaving at an alarming rate, any investment in service would result in wasteful expenditure" - this describes the supermarket's situation_

### Passage 4: Ultramarine Blue (Continued)

**Question 20: What was the primary reason that only the most illustrious painters in 17th century Europe were allowed to use ultramarine blue made from lapis lazuli?**

Options:

- It was the only pigment available
- It was considered a sacred color reserved for religious purposes
- **It was extremely expensive and cost more than its weight in gold** ✓
- It was difficult to mix with other colours

**Answer: It was extremely expensive and cost more than its weight in gold**

_Explanation: The passage explicitly states that ultramarine blue "cost more than its weight in gold," making it accessible only to the most illustrious painters_
