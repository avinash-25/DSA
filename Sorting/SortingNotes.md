# Sorting

**1. Bubble sort**

- In bubble sort algo elemets is compared algo one by one and if first element is bigger then second one then both
  elements are swapped. In this manner complete array is sorted.

`O(time) = O(n^2)`
`O(space) = O(1)`

**2. Selection sort**

- Selection sort is a sorting algo where the smallest element is selected and it is swapped with a element with i position.

`O(time) = O(n^2)`
`O(space) = O(1)`

**3. insertion sort**

- In insertion sort we compare the element from right to left and key element is insert at the right position.

`O(time) = O(n^2)`
`O(space) = O(1)`

**4. count sort**
**5. merge sort**
**6. Heap sort**
**7. Quick sort**
