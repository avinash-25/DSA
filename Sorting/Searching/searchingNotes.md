# Searching Algorithms

## 1. Linear Search

If the given array is unsorted, then we have to check or search each element one by one, which is called linear search.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 2. Binary Search

When an array is sorted, then we can search everytime the mid element and accordingly we can go in left or right, which is called binary search.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)<br>
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
